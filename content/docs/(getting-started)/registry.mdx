The ReStrictUI Registry gives you instant access to production-ready components.
Add it once, then pull in flexible, composable blocks by name—no locked templates,
just scalable pieces you can tailor to your project.

## Add registry

Add the ReStrictUI registry namespace to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@restrictui": "https://restrictui.strict-web.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

For more info, Learn more about registry config from Shadcn UI docs [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry).

## Usage

Install blocks via the shadcn CLI using the `@restrictui/{name}` syntax.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @restrictui/statistic-card-1
```

Install components via the shadcn CLI using the `@restrictui/{name}` syntax.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @restrictui/alert
```

Each block and component has CLI commands to copy and paste into your project.
